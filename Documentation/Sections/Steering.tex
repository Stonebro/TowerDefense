In this chapter we will describe: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The steering behaviors we implemented.
	\item How we implemented these steering behaviors.
	\item The issues and problems we faced while implementing the steering behaviors and how we solved these issues.
	\item How steering behaviors can be combined within our game.
\end{itemize}
A class diagram about all of the classes that are relevant to the steering behaviors can be found at the bottom of this chapter.
